The command to get top 3 biggest files in the filesystem is:

du -ah /var | sort -n -r | head -n 3

du command gives the space usage

h  - human readable format (KB or GB)
a  - all the files in the directory

Using sort command we get the output in ordered format. -r is used to sort them in descending ordered

head is used to print the first n elements here we are specifying 3 elements from the sorted list of files.
